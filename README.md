# Project Proposal


### Project title
Sports Buddy

### What and why?

For many people who enjoy playing a sport as a hobby, finding a team or someone else to play with can often times be a struggle. Your friends may be interested in playing with you, but have time conflicts or possess a vastly different skill level. Sports Buddy solves this problem by giving users the opportunity to find other people with similar time availability, age, location, and skill level to play with. 


### For whom?

The target audience for Sports Buddy consists of anyone who plays a sport and struggles or wants to find others to play with. Sports Buddy includes functionality for most major sports, meaning that you can find a hitting partner to play a two-person sport like tennis or join/create a group of multiple people to play a team sport like basketball.


### How?

Sports Buddy will consist of several different features for users. One feature is account/profile creation, where a user can display their name, age, time availibility, the sports that they are looking for someone else to play with, and their skill level in each of their listed sports. Another feature is the option to choose a specific sport to find someone else to play with, which will then show other user profiles who are also interested in finding a buddy to play that specific sport. These users can be filtered using different criteria, such as age, skill level, and time availability. Users will be then be able to click on other user profiles and message them in order to meet up and play their common sport of interest. Users can also favorite other user profiles to keep them on record for future meet ups. Lastly, users can see messages that they have received from other users and respond. 


### Scope

The real-time messaging system which will likely be the biggest challenge of the project and take a few weeks to properly implement, depending on the difficulty of learning and using socket.io plus other necessary technologies. The other features such as account creation, browsing users, and favoriting users are less complicated, but nonetheless will take some time to implement. Lastly, it also takes time to learn the technologies taught in class, familiarize ourselves with it, and be able to implement them into our project. Altogether, I do not think this project is too easy or ambitious but will be sufficient work for a group of 4 - 6 programmers to tackle in one semester.
